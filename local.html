			 		SUMMARY----------
					This program creates two records in the localStorage as the window loads.
					First, it checks if the storage already has a record with the key "sampleText",
					if not, it creates it	and sets the value. Then it alerts a message about the creation.
					However, if there is already a key called "sampleText", it gets removed from the storage.
					An alert message comes up saying that it has been removed.Followed by another indicating
					how many records are currently in the storage.
